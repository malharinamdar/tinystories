# Tinystories for regional Indian languages
### Are certain languages inherently more complex than the other?
- Work here is to analyse the inherent complexities present in different languages specifically 
in the context of Indian regional languages.


- In this work, we introduce a synthetic dataset of short stories in Hindi that only contain words that a typical
3 to 4-year-olds usually understand. We show that this dataset can be used to train and evaluate `LMs` that are much smaller
than the state-of-the-art models (below 10 million total parameters), or have much simpler architectures
(with only one transformer block), yet still produce fluent and consistent stories with several paragraphs
that are diverse and have almost perfect grammar, and demonstrate reasoning capabilities.

- This work is inspired by Ronen Eldan's paper publish in 2023, `TinyStories -  How Small Can Language Models Be and Still Speak
Coherent English?`
